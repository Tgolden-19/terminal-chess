Step 1: Download chess.zip onto your computer
Step 2: Create a directory you'd like to run chess from. For example, you might want to create a directory
by running mkdir ~/ms2_chess from the Unix terminal. Make sure to navigate there by running cd ~/ms2_chess
Step 3: Move chess.zip into the directory that you created above.
If you are on windows, you might want to run the following command (assuming you downloaded to Downloads) to coypy the
folder into your directory.

$ cp /mnt/c/Users/<windows user name>/Downloads/chess.zip .

If on Mac or Linux, move it how you would a normal file.

Step 4: After moving it to your directory, unzip it by running

$ unzip chess.zip

You should now be in the proper directory to play chess

Step 5: We use ANSITerminal for the text user interface. If it is not installed run

$ opam install ANSITerminal

If it is already installed, then Good. Else, it might prompt you to update OPAM. If so, run

$ opam update

Then, if it prompts you to upgrade afterwards, run

$ opam upgrade

Step 5: The next thing to do is Play! run the following command to play

$ make play
