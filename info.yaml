  Our project is a terminal based, two player game of chess. We visualize a 
  chessboard in the terminal, then prompt players to move pieces by typing the 
  column and row of the piece and the column and row to move the piece to--just 
  like a real chess game. 
  Our game ensures that the rules of chess are followed: you can't move a piece 
  somewhere that breaks the rules of chess. In addition, we provide support for
   complex behavior such as castling and pawn promotion. Finally, we 
   implemented check: the king cannot move into check, and a message tells 
   players when a king is in check.
